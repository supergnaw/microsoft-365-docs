**Need something else?**
    - **For help with Microsoft 365 Family or Microsoft 365 Personal**, see [Using product keys with Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/office/12a5763a-d45c-4685-8c95-a44500213759).  
    - **Volume licensing customer?** If you bought Microsoft 365 for business through a [Microsoft Open License Program](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=613298), see the article, [Enter your product key purchased from Microsoft Open](purchases-from-microsoft-open.md).
  
## Activate a new subscription

1. Go to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=839911" target="_blank">https://microsoft365.com/setupbusiness</a>.

2. Enter your product key, then select **Next**.

3. Enter your name, work email address, business phone number, company name, and country/region, then select **Next**.

4. Enter a phone number to receive either a text or call to verify your identity.

5. You can get a new domain, use a domain name you already own, or add a domain later. The steps can vary, so follow the prompts, depending on which option you choose.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to make sure that your subscription is automatically extended at the end of its term, you can add a credit card or bank account, and then [change the recurring billing setting](subscriptions/renew-your-subscription.md#change-the-recurring-billing-setting) for that subscription.

6. When you're finished, go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Admin center</a> to manage your subscription.

## Extend the expiration date or add a license to an existing subscription

Prepaid licenses for Microsoft 365 Business Standard are issued as a 25-character alphanumeric code, called a product key. If you buy another prepaid subscription for a product you already own, you can use the product key to extend the expiration date of your subscription. You can also [use a product key to add more licenses to your subscription](licenses/buy-licenses.md#add-licenses-to-a-prepaid-subscription-by-using-a-microsoft-365-product-key).

> [!NOTE]
> You must use a new, unused product key for the same Microsoft 365 plan that you bought previously. Entering your original Microsoft 365 product key won't work because a key that has already been redeemed can't be used again.

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
    - If you’re using the **Simplified view**, select **Billing**.
    - If you’re using the **Dashboard view**, go to the **Billing** > <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=842054" target="_blank">Your products</a> page.
2. Select the subscription that you want to extend.
3. On the subscription details page, in the **Subscription and payment settings** section, select **Extend end date**.
4. On the **renew or add user licenses** page, select **Use a new and unused product key**, then select **Next**.
5. Enter the product key, then select **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have more than one product key, you can select Add another product key to enter them.

6. Review your order details, then select Redeem.
